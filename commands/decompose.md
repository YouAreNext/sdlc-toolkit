Break down the PRD into atomic tasks for developers.

Use the task-decomposition skill. Input data: $ARGUMENTS

$ARGUMENTS — path to prd.md or iteration slug (e.g.: "01-article-processing").

If $ARGUMENTS is empty — offer to choose from existing PRDs in docs/discovery/.
For each task specify: role, priority, complexity, dependencies, acceptance criteria.
Group tasks by execution waves with dependencies taken into account.
