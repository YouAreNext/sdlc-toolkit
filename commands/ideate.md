Structure the idea into an Idea Brief.

Use the ideation skill. Input data: $ARGUMENTS

$ARGUMENTS can be:
- Idea description — will generate slug from it
- Empty — ask the user to describe the idea

**Important workflow:**
1. Generate a slug from the idea (e.g., "Article Reading" → `article-reading`)
2. Determine next iteration number (NN) from @docs/discovery/INDEX.md or start with 01
3. Create folder: `docs/discovery/NN-<slug>/` (e.g., `docs/discovery/01-article-reading/`)
4. Save idea-brief.md INSIDE that folder

If @docs/system-context.md exists — consider the current system state.
